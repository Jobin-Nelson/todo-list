# Todo-List

This is a simple Todo-List application built using React JavaScript. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, helping them keep track of their to-do items.

## Features

- Create tasks: Users can add new tasks by entering a task description and pressing the "Add" button.
- Update tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the corresponding checkbox or edit the task description by clicking on the task itself.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on the delete icon next to each task.
- Filter tasks: Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, or Active) to focus on specific sets of tasks.
